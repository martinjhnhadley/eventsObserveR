Description: Visualisation library designed for representing the observation of events at specific times, and (optionally)
    specific [x, y] coordinates. Originally concieved to visualise animal sightings by fixed motion-activated cameras, with the user
    able to specify the current and previous observation periods (1 day). The library provides the facility to specify 
    the locations of "places" where events are observed, otherwise "places" are equally distributed around a circle.
